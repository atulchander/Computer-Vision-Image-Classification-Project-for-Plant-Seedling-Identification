# Plant Seedlings Classification Project

## Problem Statement

### Context

- Agriculture requires modernization due to extensive manual labor in monitoring plant growth.
- Despite technological advances, recognizing plants and weeds remains time-consuming.
- Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by automating plant identification processes.
- AI and Deep Learning significantly reduce time and effort required for plant seedling identification.
- Increased efficiency can lead to better crop yields and free up human labor for higher-order decision making.
- Long-term benefits include sustainable environmental practices in agriculture.

### Objective

The aim of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant seedlings into their respective categories.

## Data Dictionary

The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species.

### Dataset Information

- The dataset can be downloaded from Olympus.
- The data file names are:
  - `images.npy`
  - `Labels.csv`
- Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to the `images.npy` file and the labels are also put into `Labels.csv`, so that you can work on the data/project seamlessly without having to worry about the high data volume.

### Goal

The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from an image.
